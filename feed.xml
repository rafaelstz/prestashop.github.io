                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Any open source project comes with its own set of rules to harmonize everybody’s contributions.
Usually the guidelines are described in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md&quot;&gt;CONTRIBUTING.md&lt;/a&gt;
file inside the project root directory.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;We’ve had a lot of great feedback since the release of version 1.6.1.0 of PrestaShop. We are very happy to see that issues seem to be few, non-critical and fixable.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Dropping support for PHP 5.2 and 5.3</title>
                
                
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;At PrestaShop, we want to make e-commerce possible for everyone. No matter where you are, no matter how much you can (or cannot) spend on your hosting, no matter how big or how small your store is. Because we’ve always made sure your PrestaShop store could run on a cheap shared hosting plan in a far far away land, we had to support PHP all the way back to version 5.2 – a version that has been unsupported &lt;a href=&quot;http://php.net/eol.php&quot;&gt;since January 2011&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
