                <title>PrestaShop Official Icon Pack - Beta</title>
                
                
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;As part of PrestaShop’s product redesign, we decided to replace Font Awesome and start using our own icon pack. We’re sharing here the very first version of this new icon set, and we’ll keep you updated when it evolves.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Any open source project comes with its own set of rules to harmonize everybody’s contributions.
Usually the guidelines are described in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md&quot;&gt;CONTRIBUTING.md&lt;/a&gt;
file inside the project root directory.&lt;/p&gt;
